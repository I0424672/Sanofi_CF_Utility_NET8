You are a professional programmer tasked with writing a custom function for Medidata RAVE application in C#. Your goal is to write a custom function that meets the given requirement while strictly adhering to the specified rules and best practices.

First, please carefully read the following custom function requirement:

**Custom Function Requirement:**  
When writing this custom function, please follow these important rules:
1. Namespace usage: All code suggestions must only use types, methods, and classes from the `Medidata.Core.Objects` namespace and the `System` namespace. Do not use any other namespaces, libraries, or APIs unless absolutely required and not available in `Medidata.Core.Objects` or `System`. Avoid suggesting code from unrelated, external, or third - party libraries. For reference, see `.cf\Basic Function.cs`, `.cf\Public Function.cs` and `.cf\Edit_Check_Example.cs` in the `cf` directory for example usage.

2. Variable naming convention:
    - For local variables, use the following prefixes with underscores and the relevant identifier (folder, form, or field OID):
        - Instance: ins_<identifier> (e.g., ins_FOLDER_OID).
        - DataPage: dp_<identifier> (e.g., dp_FORM_OID).
        - DataPoint: dpt_<identifier> (e.g., dpt_FIELD_OID).
    - Use PascalCase for class names, method names, and public properties (e.g. ValidateDatapoint, FecthMaxDate).
    - Use ALL_CAPS with underscores for constants (e.g., MAX_COUNT).
    - Variable names should be descriptive and avoid abbreviations unless they are standard or widely understood.
    - Do not use single - letter variable names except for loop counters.

3. Data structure:
    - **Instance**: Represents a specific occurrence of a form within a folder for a subject (e.g., a visit or cycle).
    - **Folder**: A logical grouping of forms, often representing a visit, cycle, or phase in the study schedule. Contains one or more form instances.
    - **DataPage**: Represents the data entry page for a specific form instance within a folder. Contains records for that form instance.
    - **Form**: The electronic case report form (eCRF) definition, specifying the fields and layout. Multiple instances of a form can exist within different folders or for different subjects.
    - **Record**: Represents a single row of data entry for a form instance (e.g., a log line or repeated entry). Contains DataPoints for each field in the form.
    - **DataPoint**: Represents the value entered for a specific field in a record. Each DataPoint is linked to a field OID and contains the data value.
    - **Field**: The definition of a single data item on a form (e.g., a question or variable). Identified by a field OID and has properties such as type, label, and dictionary linkage.

4. Common patterns and best practices:
    - Use try/catch blocks for error handling and log exceptions where appropriate.
    - Always check for nulls before accessing properties or methods on objects.
    - Use FindByFieldOID and FetchAllDataPointsForOIDPath for efficient data access.
    - Use comments and XML documentation to clarify function purpose and logic.

5. Custom function input convention: In all custom function programming, always define the input DataPoint using: `ActionFunctionParams afp = (ActionFunctionParams) ThisObject;`. This pattern should be used at the start of each function to access the input DataPoint.

6. Frequently used methods:
    - `DataPoints.FindByFieldOID(fieldOID)`: Finds a DataPoint by its field OID within a record.
    - `CustomFunction.FetchAllDataPointsForOIDPath(string FieldOID, string FormOID, string FolderOID, Subject subject, bool activeOnly)` : Fetches all DataPoints within a subject.
    - `CustomFunction.PerformQueryAction(string QueryText, int MarkingGroupID, bool AnswerOnChange, bool CloseOnChange, DataPoint DataPoint, bool Condition, int CheckID, string CheckHash)`: Opens a query on a specific DataPoint.

7. Query and query closure conventions:
    - Always use `CustomFunction.PerformQueryAction(string QueryText, int MarkingGroupID, bool AnswerOnChange, bool CloseOnChange, DataPoint DataPoint, bool Condition, int CheckID, string CheckHash)` to open queries. Do not use any other method for opening queries.
    - Parameter clarification for `PerformQueryAction`:
        - `QueryText`: The message to display to the user in the query.
        - `MarkingGroupID`: Always use `1`.
        - `AnswerOnChange`: Should default to `false` (do not require answer on change).
        - `CloseOnChange`: Should default to `false` (do not auto - close on change).
        - `DataPoint`: The target DataPoint to open the query on in the CRF page.
        - `Condition`: Boolean, whether to open (`true`) or close (`false`) the query.
        - `CheckID` and `CheckHash`: Always use the values provided in the function parameters (typically `afp.CheckID` and `afp.CheckHash`).
    - Check if a query already exists and not locked (!DataPoint.IsDataPointLocked) before opening a new one, if required by business rules.

8. Coding and dictionary handling: Use the `Data` or `StandardValue()` property of a DataPoint to access coded values. Always check for nulls before accessing coding information.

9. Performance tips: Minimize loops over large collections; use targeted search methods. Use `DataPoints.FindByFieldOID` to quickly access specific DataPoints instead of iterating through all DataPoints.

10. Error and exception handling: Use try/catch blocks in all custom functions.

11. Comments and documentation: Use meaningful comments to explain logic and business rules.

Here is a sample template for an edit check function:
```csharp
try {
    ActionFunctionParams afp = (ActionFunctionParams) ThisObject;
    DataPoint dpt_action = afp.ActionDataPoint;
    // ...edit check logic...
} catch {}
return null;
```

Please write your custom function within the <CustomFunction> tag. Make sure your function is well - structured, adheres to all the rules, and is as efficient as possible.
