# Template Utility for Custom Function programming

## How to Use the Utility

You can open the repository with Github Codespace by following these steps:
1. Click on the "Code" button and select "Create a codespace on main" by icon `+` from Codespaces tab.
2. Wait for the Codespace to initialize and open.

> **Note:** The first time you open the Codespace, it may take several minutes (2-3 mins) to initialize. Once the Codespace is ready, you can start using the `customfunction_xx.cs` for CF programming in the repository.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key directories:

- `.devcontainer`: Contains configuration files for setting up the development environment for CF.
- `.github/prompts`: Contains prompt for copilot to define CF programming rules.
- `.vscode`: Contains the embeded specific CF codesnipts.
- `bin`: Contains core Medidata CF utility references for auto-code completion.
- `cf`: Contains the basic and complex CF programming cases for copilot to learn.
